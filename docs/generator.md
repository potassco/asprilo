# About

This is the user manual of the instance generator of [asprilo](index.md).

# Installation

We **highly recommend** to install the generator with [conda](https://conda.io/):

1.  [Install either Anaconda or Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
2.  [Create and activate a fresh conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html), e.g. via

    ``` bash
    conda create -n myenv
    conda activate myenv
    ```

3.  To install the generator in your environment, run

    ``` bash
    conda install -c potassco asprilo-generator
    ```

4.  Run

    ``` bash
    gen -h
    ```

    to verify that the generator installed correctly.

## Manual Installation (Not Supported!)

Alternatively, you can install the generator manually by downloading its source code from
[https://github.com/potassco/asprilo](https://github.com/potassco/asprilo). However, you must install all
requirements by yourself and probably adjust some environment variables (e.g. `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`).
Please note that this method is **not supported**!

## Requirements

For manual installation, the generator requires the following software installed on
your system:

1. [clingo5](http://github.com/potassco/clingo)>=5.5.0
2. [Python](http://www.python.org)>=3.9
3. [PyYAML](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml)>=5.4.1

# Name Convention for Instance Files

Generated instance files are automatically named in adherence to the scheme

    x<X>_y<X>_n<N>_r<R>_s<S>_ps<PS>_pr<PR>_u<U>_o<o>_N<NI>.lp

where

- `<X>` is the maximum x-dimension
- `<Y>` is the maximum y-dimension
- `<N>` is the number of nodes
- `<R>` is the number of robots
- `<S>` is the number of shelves
- `<PS>` is the number of picking stations
- `<PR>` is the number of products
- `<U>` is the number of product units globally, i.e., total across all products
- `<O>` is the number of orders
- `<NI>` is the instance count number

Example

    x10_y10_n100_r5_s20_ps5_pr5_u48_o6_N003.lp

is an instance where

- `10` is the maximum x-dimension
- `10` is the maximum y-dimension
- `100` is the number of nodes
- `5` is the number of robots
- `20` is the number of shelves
- `5` is the number of picking stations
- `5` is the number of products
- `48` is the number of product units globally, i.e., total across all products
- `6` is the number of orders
- `3` is the instance count number

## Batch Generation

Instead of running the instance generator with a single configuration of parameters from the command
line, there is also support for batch generation based on a range of different configurations: batch
files are defined in [YAML](yaml.org) syntax, for example the batch
files

- [`./generator/scripts/batch/abc/structured.yml`]({{ site.asprilo_src_url }}/generator/scripts/batch/abc/structured.yml) and
- [`./generator/scripts/batch/abc/random.yml`]({{ site.asprilo_src_url }}/generator/scripts/batch/abc/random.yml)

describe a set of structured and random instances, respectively, suited for domain A-C. The generator can process them via the `--batch` command line option, e.g.

    gen --batch ./generator/scripts/batch/abc/structured.yml -I -t 4 -V

### Batch File Format

-   A valid batch file always contains exactly two top-level dictionaries:

    - `global_settings` describing configuration parameters that should be used globally, i.e., for each instance generation job
    - `run_configs` describing the generation jobs represented as collection of different
            configurations

-   Basic Job Definition:

    - Within the `run_configs` tree, a user can represent a single instance generation job by a
      dictionary, that is not only an ancestor of `run_configs` but also all its predecessors must
      be dictionaries; in the resulting instance set, the paths from `run_configs` to job dictionaries are translated
      correspondingly into directory trees in the file system
    - Further, a job dictionary must have a child directory with the reserved name `args` that, in
      turn, specifies the job's configuration parameters in a dictionary
    - Each job dictionary, that is, their parameters specified by their `args` child dictionary will
      be processed as single instance generation job by the generation

-   Recursive Job Definition:

    - Optionally, a job dictionary may also contain a child or ancestor dictionary that in turn
      define jobs, i.e., contain an `args` child dictionary; That is, down-stream job dictionaries
      inherit the configuration parameters from their ancestor job dictionaries
    - Eventually, only those job dictionaries which have no ancestor job dictionaries are executed
      by the instance generator
