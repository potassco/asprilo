# About

This is the description of the referential benchmark sets of ASPRILO.


# Instance File Naming Convention

Instances files are named as

    x<X>_y<X>_n<N>_r<R>_s<S>_ps<PS>_pr<PR>_u<U>_o<o>_N<NI>.lp

where

- `<X>` is the maximum x-dimension
- `<Y>` is the maximum y-dimension
- `<N>` is the number of nodes
- `<R>` is the number of robots
- `<S>` is the number of shelves
- `<PS>` is the number of picking stations
- `<PR>` is the number of products
- `<U>` is the number of product units globally, i.e., total across all products
- `<O>` is the number of orders
- `<NI>` is the instance count number

Example

    x10_y10_n100_r5_s20_ps5_pr5_u48_o6_N3.lp

is an instance where

- `10` is the maximum x-dimension
- `10` is the maximum y-dimension
- `100` is the number of nodes
- `5` is the number of robots
- `20` is the number of shelves
- `5` is the number of picking stations
- `5` is the number of products
- `48` is the number of product units globally, i.e., total across all products
- `6` is the number of orders
- `3` is the instance count number


# Generating Benchmark Sets

The script `./generator/test_instances.py` generates a family of categorized instances
(by repeatedly invoking `./generator/ig.py` with different input parameters). Each
category emphasizes distinct key characteristics typical to the problem. In particular,
the following categories have been provided:

- `standard_cases`: scenarios based on potential real-life settings
- `tiny_cases`: extremely tiny toy scenarios
- `grid_scaling`: scenarios regarding different sizes of the grid
- `shelves_scaling`: scenarios regarding different numbers of shelves
- `robots_scaling`: scenarios regarding different numbers of robots
- `pickingstations_scaling`: scenarios regarding different numbers of picking stations
- `product_units_orders_scaling`: scenarios regarding combinations of different numbers of product units and orders

For instances, for the category `standard_cases`, a set of 10 instances can be generated by

    python ./generator/test_instances.py -N 10 -d <DEST>

where the resulting instances would be save at directory `<DEST>`. Further, one can split
instances into warehouse and order related facts via additional command line option `--split` as follows

    python ./generator/test_instances.py -N 10 -d <DEST> --split 5 10

where the first parameter of split specifies the number of warehouses instances (here 5), and the second
parameter the number of order instances (here 10) per each warehouse instance.
A set of the referential instances generated by

    python ./generator/test_instances.py -N 10 -d <DEST> --split 10 10

can be found in the latest [ASPRILO release](https://github.com/potassco/asprilo/releases).
